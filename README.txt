# Homework 3 Submission
## by Albina Gibadullina

Hi, this is repository for Homework 3 for STAT 545A. In it, I will be analyzing `gapminder` dataset by using `ggplot2` and `dplyr` packages.

You can find the following files here:
- [hw03.md](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw03-albina23/blob/master/hw04.md) is for github review.
- [hw03.Rmd](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-albina23/blob/master/hw04.Rmd) is the corresponding R markdown source file.
- [data file](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-albina23/blob/master/data%20file/IP2LOCATION-COUNTRY-INFORMATION.CSV) is the dataframe I used in part 2 of the assignment.

In this project, I will be modifying `gapminder` dataset as well as merging `gapminder` dataset with other datasets. Specifically, I will show you how to do: 

1. **Data Reshaping Prompt 2** - Make a tibble with one row per year and columns for life expectancy for two or more countries. 
2. **Join Prompt 1** - Create a second data frame, complementary to Gapminder, join this with Gapminder using a dplyr join function and make some observations about the process and result.
